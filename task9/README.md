implement a flight management system you have to form a graph with atleast 10 nodes which willplay the role of airports every edge will have 2 types of weight and weight of edges of the graph will describe fare and distance from one node to another user can ask to find the cheapest route between 2 airport or the fastest and you have to find this routes for user at any instant you can be asked to crash(or delete) an airport(or node) and have to again do all the processing to find all the routes at any instant you can also be asked to add a new airport and the destination airport for the flights taking off from that airport you have to keep in mind while performing it you have to check if on adding a new edge if cycle is formed in the graph you have to discard that edge(source airport to destination airport flight)
