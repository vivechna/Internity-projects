Evaluation 3

1.Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that themaximum length of s is 1000.Example 1:Input: "babad"Output: "bab"Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.Example 2:Input: "cbbd"Output: "bb

2.Given astring containing digits from ​2-9​ inclusive, return all possible letter combinationsthat the number could represent.A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that1 does not map to any letters.Example:Input: "23"Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

3.Given an array ​nums​ of ​n​ integers and an integer ​target​, are there elements ​a​, ​b​, ​c​, andd​ in ​nums​ such that​a​ + ​b​ + ​c​ + ​d​ = ​target​? Find all unique quadruplets in the array whichgives the sum of ​target​.Note:The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.Example:Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.A solution set is:[  [-1,  0, 0, 1],  [-2, -1, 1, 2],  [-2,  0, 0, 2]]

4.Have the function plusMinus(num) read the num parameterbeing passed which will be acombination of 1 or more single digits, and determine if it is possible to separate thedigits with either a plus or minus sign to get the final expression to equal zero. If num is35132 then it ispossible to separate the digits the following way, 3-5+1+3-2, and theexpression equals zero. Your program should return a string of the sign you used, so forthis example, your program should return -++-. If it is not possible to get the digitexpression to equal zero, return the string not possible.If there are multiple ways to get thefinal expression to equal zero, choose the one thatcontains more minus characters. For example, if num is 26712 your program shouldreturn -+-- and not +-+-.Input1: 199Output1: Not possibleInput2: 26712Output2: +-+-

5.Given a string str and n identical consists of choosing n adjacent and equal letters fromstr and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring toconcatenate together.We repeatedly make n identical removals on str until we no longer can.Returns the final string all such identical removals have been made. It is guaranteed thatthe answer is unique.Constraints:1 <= str.length <= 10^42 <= n <= 10^3Str only contains lower case English letters.Example 1:Input: “wxyz” k = 2Output: “wxyz”Explanation: There’s nothing to delete.Example 2:Input: “deeedbbcccbdaa” k = 3Output: aa”Explanation:First delete “eee” and “ccc” get “ddbbbdaa”Second delete “bbb”, get “dddaa”Finally delete “ddd”,get “aa”

6.Given a set of candidate numbers (​candidates​) (without duplicates) and a target number(​target​), find all unique combinations in ​candidates​ where the candidate numbers sumsto ​target​.The same repeated number may be chosen from ​candidates​ unlimited number of times.Note:●All numbers (including ​target​) will be positive integers.●The solution set must not containduplicate combinations.Example 1:Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,A solution set is:[  [7],  [2,2,3]]Example 2:Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,A solution set is:[  [2,2,2,2], [2,3,3],  [3,5]]

7.Given ​n​ non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the widthof each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram. Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = ​[2,1,5,6,2,3]​.The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = ​10​ unit.Example:Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]Output: 10

8.Given a collection of candidate numbers (​candidates​) and a target number (​target​), findall unique combinations in ​candidates​ where the candidate numbers sums to ​target​.Each number in ​candidates​ may only be used once in the combination.Note: ●All numbers (including ​target​) will be positive integers.●The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.Example 1:Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,A solution set is:[  [1, 7],  [1, 2, 5],  [2, 6],  [1, 1, 6]]

9.You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Findall starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in wordsexactly once and without any intervening characters.Example 1:Input:  s = "barfoothefoobarman",  words = ["foo","bar"]Output: [0,9]Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and"foobar" respectively.The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.Example 2:Input:  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",  words = ["word","good","best","word"]Output: []

10.The ​n​-queens puzzle is the problem of placing ​n​ queens on an ​n​×​n​ chessboard suchthat no two queens attack each other.Given an integer ​n​, return all distinct solutions to the ​n​-queens puzzle.Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the ​n​-queens' placement, where ​'Q'​ and'.'​ both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.Example:Input: 4Output: [ [".Q..",  // Solution 1  "...Q",  "Q...",  "..Q."], ["..Q.",  // Solution 2  "Q...",  "...Q",  ".Q.."]]Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queenspuzzle as shown above.
