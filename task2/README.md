## Sorting Algorithms

"implementation and comparision of different sorting quick-sort, merge sort, radix sort, count sort, heap sort, insertion sort
findings and analysis:
		find which sorting algorithm is best suited for which type of data set, run algorithms for different custom data set with atleast 100 entries and show comparision of these sorting algorithms on atleast 10 different data set
find best case, worst case for each sorting algorithm."
